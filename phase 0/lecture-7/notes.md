while vs do while
=> condition is checked first in while loop where in "do while", code is executed first that checking the condition

i++ vs ++i
=> The value of i is incremented for both of the syntax but when we assign value in another variable, then the varible value gets updated with the i value for ++i. This is called pre-incremental. For other case, the variable store the value of i first.
int i = 1;
int j = i++; // j = 1

int i = 1;
int j = ++i; // j = 2
